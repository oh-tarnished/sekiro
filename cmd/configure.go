// configureCmd represents the configure command
var configureCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "configure",
	Short: "Configure the development environment",
	Long: `The configure command sets up the necessary tools and programs required for a smooth development workflow. This includes installing and configuring tools like AWS CLI, Google Cloud CLI (gcloud), GitHub CLI, as well as essential programs like yq and jq.

This command ensures that your local environment is ready for development, taking care of dependencies and configuration steps that are typically repetitive and time-consuming. It's an essential step to make sure that the development environment aligns with the project's requirements.

Usage examples:

- To configure the entire environment:
  ` + "`./sekiro configure`" + `

- To configure a specific tool (if such functionality is supported):
  ` + "`./sekiro configure --tool awscli`" + `

Before running this command, ensure that you have the necessary permissions for software installation and system configuration changes. The command might require internet access to download tools and dependencies.`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("configure called")
		// Implementation details for the configuration process
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(configureCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// configureCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// configureCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
